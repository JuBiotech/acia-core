Quickstart Guide (3-steps)
--------

1. Make sure you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) installed. You can check a valid installation by entering "anaconda" into your windows search. This should open a command line and the command

```
conda --version
```
shows you the version information.
If this. works without any error, you're ready to go on.

2. Create a new environment using

```
conda create -n mlflow -c conda-forge -y mlflow
conda activate mlflow
```
